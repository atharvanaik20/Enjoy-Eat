## Conclusion and Future Scope

ENJOY EAT provides a better way of managing the food ordering system, from placing the order to its delivery. Our system offers a user-friendly platform where customers can easily browse the menu, place their orders, and have them delivered to their doorstep, particularly with cash-on-delivery as the current payment mode. In the future, we plan to integrate online payment methods to enhance convenience and flexibility for customers.

The hoteling industry is an evergreen industry as people will continue to dine out to enjoy a break from their everyday home-cooked meals. With ENJOY EAT, we aim to bring restaurants a step closer to customers' homes by enabling restaurant owners to efficiently manage and streamline the online food delivery process.

### Future Scope:
- Online Payment Integration: We plan to implement secure online payment methods to allow customers to make digital payments for their orders, providing a seamless and convenient experience.
- Advanced Order Tracking: Enhancing the system with real-time order tracking functionality will enable customers to track the progress of their orders from preparation to delivery, ensuring transparency and improving customer satisfaction.
- Personalized Recommendations: Implementing a recommendation system based on customer preferences and ordering history can enhance the user experience by providing personalized food recommendations and offers.
- Analytics and Reporting: Adding comprehensive analytics and reporting features will help restaurant owners gain insights into their business performance, customer trends, popular food items, and sales data, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
- Mobile Application: Developing a mobile application for ENJOY EAT will expand its reach and provide a more convenient way for customers to browse the menu, place orders, and track deliveries using their smartphones.

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to further enhance the ENJOY EAT system and bring more innovative features to benefit both customers and restaurant owners.
